Notes on the book

To cover:
- basic types section
- looping: named let, for-each, map, do
- lists, pairs, quoting, eval
- vectors and hash-tables

- move closures into part 2, advanced scheme

- I think the intro to quoting should happen right after variables
  so we can show quoted symbols and keywords
